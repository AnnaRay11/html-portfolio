<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Anna Rayner and this is my road trip of learning something new, something that I have never done before but really wanted to. </br>
   This website is the beginning of my adventure as the Web Developer and it is going to show the progress I am making while learing </br>
  (especially for those days when I feel down and demotivated).</p>

<p>I wish myself best of luck! If I can dream it, I can do it!</p>

<p>By the way, anyone who is curiouse or starting something new in their life too, or simply bored and stumbled upon this website by accident is</br> 
  welcomed   :)
